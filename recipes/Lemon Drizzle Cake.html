    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This lemon drizzle cake is one of my favorite easy recipes. 
        I love a good slice of cake and a cup of tea, particularly when it's warm and sunny outside. And nothing says sunshine like bright yellow, zesty lemons.
         When life gives you lemons, make lemon cake!</p>
    <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, slightly softened</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 Â¾ cups self-rising flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 lemon, zested</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a loaf pan with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. 
            Sift in flour and baking powder gradually; fold with a wooden spoon to be sure flour is combined. Stir in lemon zest.</li>
        <li>Pour batter into the prepared pan, being careful not to press it down.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
             Try not to open the oven door early to avoid collapsing the fluffy cake.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the lemon glaze: Juice the zested lemon from the cake batter into a small bowl. Add zest and juice of the second lemon. Stir in 7 tablespoons sugar until dissolved.</li>
        <li>Pour glaze over the warm cake and leave to cool in the pan; glaze will harden as the cake cools.</li>
       
    </ol>
